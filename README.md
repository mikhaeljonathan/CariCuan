# Cari Cuan

This "Cari Cuan" project is an Android app project for our "Object Oriented Programming" assignment in Binus University. CariCuan is an small e-commerce app that can help students in PPA/PPTI BCA to make transactions online. At this point, we didn't study about the database yet, so we didn't make the database system in this app very well. This app is made by Angela Susanto, Mikhael Jonathan, and Rio Oktavianes
